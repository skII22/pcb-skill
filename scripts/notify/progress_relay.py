"""Relay the progress of a long job to a human, over any transport you name.

WHAT THIS DOES
    Watches a log file and a milestone directory, and speaks through a COMMAND TEMPLATE
    you supply.  Four rules, and the fourth is the one people leave out:

      1. SPEAK ONLY ON CHANGE.  New log lines, or a new file matching `--milestone-glob`.
      2. NEVER MORE OFTEN THAN `--min-gap` SECONDS.  A chatty job must not be able to
         spam a phone.
      3. ALWAYS SPEAK AT LEAST EVERY `--heartbeat` SECONDS while the job is alive.
         SILENCE MUST NEVER BE AMBIGUOUS.  This rule exists because a routing run was
         left alone for 10 hours 53 minutes: the job looked fine, nothing said anything,
         and "no news" was indistinguishable from "wedged".  A heartbeat that says
         "still running, 214 minutes, no new log lines" is worth more than a hundred
         progress messages, because it converts silence into information.
      4. STOP ON COMPLETION.  When `--done-file` appears, when `--pid` exits, or at the
         `--max-seconds` cap -- and say WHICH of those happened.

WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE
    * Whether the job is doing anything USEFUL.  It relays what the log says.  For a
      router, pair it with routing/route_supervise.py, which judges the rate.
    * Whether the message arrived.  A transport failure is caught and reported to stdout,
      and the relay keeps going -- a broken notifier must never take the job down with
      it.  If delivery matters, check the other end.
    * Anything about the content.  Log lines are passed through as text.

TRANSPORT
    `--command` is a shell template.  These placeholders are substituted:
        {title}   a short subject line
        {body}    the message body
        {kind}    one of: start | progress | heartbeat | done | timeout | error
        {file}    path to a temporary file containing the body (for long messages)
    The command is run through the shell, so quote the placeholders yourself.  Example:

        --command 'notify-send {title} {body}'
        --command 'mail -s {title} me@example.org < {file}'
        --command 'curl -s -X POST -d @{file} https://example.invalid/hook'

    NO TRANSPORT IS BUILT IN AND NO CREDENTIAL IS EVER READ, STORED OR LOGGED BY THIS
    SCRIPT.  If your transport needs a token, keep it in that transport's own config or
    environment, outside this file and outside your repository.
    `--command` is optional: with none, messages go to stdout, which is a perfectly good
    way to test the relay before pointing it at anything.

HOW IT WAS VALIDATED
    Ported from the relay used to follow a multi-hour routing run, where the heartbeat
    rule is what stopped a stall from going unnoticed a second time.  `--selftest` runs
    the whole loop against a synthetic log with a fake clock and a recording transport,
    so it takes milliseconds and asserts the exact message sequence.

USAGE
    python3 progress_relay.py --log run.log [--milestone-dir out --milestone-glob '*.ses']
             [--done-file report.md] [--pid 1234] [--command 'notify-send {title} {body}']
             [--poll 60] [--min-gap 600] [--heartbeat 2700] [--max-seconds 50400]
             [--tail 8] [--title 'my job']
    python3 progress_relay.py --selftest
