"""Shared 2D geometry primitives for the PCB checkers.

WHAT THIS MEASURES
    Exact planar distances between the outlines that PCB primitives really have:
    rectangles, rounded rectangles, obrounds (stadiums), circles, capsules (a stroked
    track) and arbitrary polygons.  Distances are edge-to-edge in millimetres, with
    full containment reported as 0.0.

WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE
    * Nothing about layers, nets, or electrical meaning -- callers decide which pairs
      are even worth measuring.
    * Nothing 3D.  Everything here is a flat outline at z = 0.
    * Curves are flattened into polygons before they get here, so a reported distance
      carries the flattening error of whoever built the polygon (see `circle_poly`'s
      `n` argument: 48 segments on a 0.5 mm circle is ~0.5 um of chord sag).
    * `poly_distance` is O(len(P) * len(Q)).  It is exact, not fast.  Callers must do
      their own bounding-box rejection first; every caller in this toolkit does.

HOW IT WAS VALIDATED
    Ported from the clearance sweep of a released 4-layer board, where these routines
    reproduced the EDA's own DRC minimum (0.1020 mm over 3248 measured pairs) and,
    separately, its three hole-to-hole findings exactly.  `--selftest` re-checks the
    containment fix and the analytic cases below on synthetic input.

FAULT FIXED HERE (fault 2 of 4 -- "polygon distance blind to full containment")
    The original `poly_dist` computed edge-to-edge distance only.  When one polygon
    lies WHOLLY INSIDE another, no pair of edges crosses, so it returned a positive,
    confident, and completely wrong clearance: a large tantalum land that had entirely
    swallowed an 0805 pad still reported 0.22 mm of clearance, and the placement gate
    that consumed the number passed the board.  `poly_distance` below tests containment
    explicitly, in BOTH directions, before it measures any edges.
