"""Supervise a long autoroute: a four-state watchdog plus a connections-per-minute floor.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    An autorouter can fail in four different ways and only one of them looks like a
    failure.  On the reference project a run was left alone for 10 hours 53 minutes
    because nothing said anything: the process was alive, the log was growing, and it
    had stopped making progress hours earlier.  A supervisor that only asks "is it
    still running?" cannot tell a working router from a wedged one.

THE FOUR STATES  (checked in this order, every --poll seconds)
    1. OUTPUT PRESENT   -- the result file exists and is non-empty and has stopped
                           growing.  This is SUCCESS and it is checked FIRST, because a
                           router that finishes and exits also trips states 3 and 4.
    2. CRASH SIGNATURE  -- a --crash-pattern regex matched in the log.  Stack overflow,
                           out-of-memory and null-pointer traces all look like ordinary
                           output to a size check.  Exit code alone is not enough: a JVM
                           that dies inside a worker thread can still exit 0.
    3. PROCESS GONE     -- the --pid is no longer alive and state 1 did not fire.  That
                           is a silent death, and it is a distinct failure from a crash
                           with a message.
    4. WALL CLOCK       -- --max-seconds elapsed.  A cap that is never reached costs
                           nothing; one that is missing costs a night.

    Plus the rate floor, which is the state that is easy to leave out:
    5. RATE FLOOR       -- connections gained per MINUTE, over the last --rate-window
                           passes, below --min-rate.  PER-PASS improvement is the WRONG
                           metric: a router's passes get longer as the board fills (2:59
                           to 9:56 on one measured run), so a fixed per-pass threshold
                           silently tightens and condemns a run that is still working.
                           Judge per unit of TIME.

WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE
    * Whether the route is any good.  A run that finishes fast can finish wrong.
      route_accept.py decides that, on the board read back from the EDA.
    * Progress a router makes without logging it.  The rate floor needs the log lines
      that --pass-regex matches; if it matches nothing, the rate check is REPORTED AS
      UNAVAILABLE rather than treated as a stall.  Silence must never be scored as zero.
    * Whether the process it is watching is the right one.  --pid is taken on trust.
    * Anything on another machine.  It reads local files and sends signals to nobody.

    This supervisor never kills anything.  It reports a verdict and exits with a code;
    what to do about a stalled router is a decision, and killing a job that is 95 %
    done because a threshold fired is a bad one to automate.

HOW IT WAS VALIDATED
    The rate parser is a port of the stall judge written for a released board's routing
    runs; re-run against those logs it reproduces the per-pass timings and the
    "still progressing" / "stalled" verdicts.  `--selftest` runs the whole state machine
    against synthetic logs and a temporary output file.
