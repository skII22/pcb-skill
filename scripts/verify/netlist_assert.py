"""Run explicit connectivity assertions against the board: must-connect,
must-not-connect, must-be-open.

WHAT THIS MEASURES
    PHYSICAL connectivity, from geometry, ignoring net names entirely.  Every piece of
    copper on the board -- pads, tracks, vias -- is grouped by whether outlines actually
    touch on a shared layer.  The assertions are then evaluated against those groups:

      must_connect      every member of the group lands in the SAME copper group
      must_not_connect  no two members share a copper group
      must_be_open      the member's group contains nothing but itself

    A member is either a pad reference "U1.7" or a net name "GND" (which expands to
    every pad the netlist gives that net).

    Names are used only to FIND the copper; the verdict comes from geometry.  That is
    the point: a short is two pieces of copper touching, whatever the netlist calls
    them, and an EDA's own net-based check cannot see a short it has already absorbed
    into its net model.

WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE
    * Pour copper, unless you declare it.  A net closed by a plane or a pour will read
      as many groups here.  Pass `--plane-nets GND,AGND`: any group that carries a via
      or a through-hole pad is then treated as reaching the plane.  That is a MODEL, not
      a measurement -- the measurement is the Gerber (verify/clearance.py, which reports
      copper claimed by two nets).
    * Resistance.  Two pads joined by a 0.1 mm 40 mm trace "connect" here.
    * Components.  A must-connect through a series resistor is NOT connected copper and
      correctly fails; assert the two halves separately.
    * Anything about intent.  You write the assertions; this only checks them.

WHY BOTH DIRECTIONS MATTER
    A board that passes must-connect and has never been asked a must-not-connect
    question has not been checked for shorts at all.  Write the negative assertions --
    supply rails against each other and against ground, a differential pair's two
    halves, anything switched -- and write must-be-open for every test point and unused
    pin you expect to float.

HOW IT WAS VALIDATED
    The connectivity core is the same union-find that decided acceptance on a released
    board.  `--selftest` runs assertions of all three kinds against a synthetic board
    with a deliberate short and a deliberate open.

USAGE
    python3 netlist_assert.py board.json assertions.json [--plane-nets "GND"]
                              [--json out.json]
    python3 netlist_assert.py --selftest

ASSERTIONS FILE
    {
      "must_connect":     [["U1.1", "C1.2"], ["U1.20", "U1.21", "L1.1"]],
      "must_not_connect": [["VBUS", "GND"], ["U1.5", "U1.6"]],
      "must_be_open":     ["TP1.1", "U1.44"]
    }
    Those references are an EXAMPLE shape, not a suggested set -- every board's
    assertions are its own.
